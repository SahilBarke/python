Why Do We Yawn?

Yawning isnâ€™t just a sign of being tiredâ€”itâ€™s actually a fascinating brain function!
Scientists believe yawning helps cool the brain, improving alertness.
It also increases oxygen intake and promotes better blood circulation.
Ever noticed that yawning is contagious? Thatâ€™s because of social bondingâ€”our brains mimic others to connect!
Even animals, from dogs to chimpanzees, yawn in response to others.
Interestingly, we also yawn when stressed, bored, or even before important events.
So next time you yawn in a meeting, just say youâ€™re optimizing your brain! ðŸ˜†
